# XXRTool
The XXR Tool is a design tool for extending the reality of AR and VR projects using other senses. This was part of my graduation (womeijer.com/graduation) at the TU Delft. The result of running this tool is avalible at [https://github.com/womei/Demo42](https://github.com/womei/Demo42)

The XXR tool consists of 6 posters (see posters.pdf) and complementary sense cards (see cards.pdf) these are used together in a workshop setting to consider all of the avalible senses and select the best ones based on project requirments.
